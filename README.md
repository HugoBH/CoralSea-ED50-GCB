Abstract: 
Scleractinian coral populations are being exposed to conditions above their upper thermal limits due to increasing marine heatwaves, contributing to global declines of coral reef ecosystem health. However, historic mass bleaching events indicate there is considerable inter- and intra- specific variation in thermal tolerance whereby species, individual coral colonies and populations show differential susceptibility to exposure to elevated temperatures. Despite this, we lack a clear understanding of how heat tolerance varies across large contemporary and historical environmental gradients, or the selective pressures that underpin variation. Here we conducted standardised acute heat stress experiments to identify variation in heat tolerance among species and isolated reefs spanning a large environmental gradient across the Coral Sea Marine Park. We quantified the dark-adapted maximum photosynthetic yield of coral samples in three coral species, Acropora cf humilis, Pocillopora meandrina and Pocillopora verrucosa, following exposure to four temperature treatments (local maximum monthly mean temperatures, and +3 oC, +6 oC and +9 oC above). We used dark-adapted photosynthetic yield of photosystem II to… (PSII-50) to compare acute heat tolerance across reefs and species. Using this metric, we recorded 0.8 oC to 1.7 oC phenotypic variation in heat tolerance among reefs within species, indicating spatial heterogeneity in heat tolerance across broad environmental gradients. We also recorded 0.7 oC variation in thresholds between Acropora and Pocillopora, and 0.3 oC variation among the two Pocillopora species. Higher acute heat tolerance was strongly associated with increased exposure to mild heatwaves since 1985. The relationship to mild heatwaves was 2.6-fold stronger for Acropora than Pocillopora, indicating that taxa with higher susceptibility may acclimate more rapidly to changing thermal conditions. Phenotypic variation associated with mild thermal history in local environments provides supportive evidence that marine heatwaves are selecting for tolerant individuals and populations, providing a basis for evolutionary and adaptive processes to act upon.
